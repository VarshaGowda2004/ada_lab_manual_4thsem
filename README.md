## Installation/pre-requisites

To compile and run this project locally, follow these steps to install Code::Blocks:

1. **Download Code::Blocks:**
   - Visit [Code::Blocks download page](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads).
   - Download the installer for your operating system.

2. **Install Code::Blocks:**
   - Run the downloaded installer.
   - Follow the installation wizard instructions.
   - Make sure to include any necessary components (like compilers) during the installation.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open Code::Blocks after installation to ensure it launches correctly.

Once Code::Blocks is installed, you can open the project file (.cbp) in Code::Blocks and build/run the project from within the IDE.

## Lab program details 
1.Design and implement C Program to sort a given set of n integer elements using
Selection Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied
values of n> 5000 and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus
n. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number
generator.

2.Design and implement C Program to sort a given set of n integer elements using
Quick Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values
of n> 5000 and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The
elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number
generator.

3.Design and implement C Program to sort a given set of n integer elements using
Merge Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values
of n> 5000, and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus n.
The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number
generator.

4.Design and implement C Program to obtain the Topological ordering of vertices in a
given digraph.

5.Design and implement C Program to solve 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic
Programming method.
